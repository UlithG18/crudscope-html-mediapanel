# CRUDScope - HTML MediaPanel
# Project Description

This project is a basic HTML media and task panel, it was created to practice fundamental HTML structure, semantic elements, forms, tables, multimedia tags, and internal navigation

# Tag Research

- Structure Tags

html, head, body, title, base, meta
Used to define the general structure of a webpage. A typical use is creating the basic HTML document with metadata and a title.

- Semantic Tags

header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer, address, time
These tags describe the meaning of each part of the page. They are used to organize content logically, such as placing navigation inside <nav> or grouping content inside <section>.

- Non-semantic Tags

div, span
These tags do not describe meaning. They are used mainly for layout, grouping, or styling when no semantic tag fits.

- Text Tags

h1–h3, p, strong, em, u, mark, abbr
Used to format text and create titles or highlighted information. A typical use is writing a page heading with <h1> or emphasizing text with <strong>.

-  Table Tags

table, tr, th, td
Used to create and structure tabular data. A typical use is displaying rows of tasks inside a table.

-  Form Tags

form, label, input, textarea, button
Used to collect user information. A typical case is building a form where the user can create a new task.

- Multimedia Tags

img, audio, video, source
Used to display images and play audio or video directly on the page.

# Semantic vs Non-semantic Tags

A semantic tag describes the purpose of the content (example: <header> for the top section of a page).
A non-semantic tag does not provide meaning and is used mainly for layout (example: <div> for grouping elements).

Semantic tags are useful for accessibility and organization.
Non-semantic tags are useful when no semantic element describes the content properly.

Focus on Less Common Tags

# <base>

The <base> tag sets a base URL for every relative link in the document. If used, all relative paths in <a>, <img>, <audio>, etc., will follow this base URL.

# <abbr>

Displays an abbreviation and provides its full meaning through the title attribute. It helps readers understand shortened terms.

# <time>

Represents a specific time or date, it helps browsers and search engines interpret dates

# Multimedia Tags Advantage

Using <audio> and <video> allows the media to play directly on the webpage without external players or links. It improves usability and provides built-in controls.
